            <h1>The One with What's it All About</h1>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Friends is an American television sitcom that revolves around six 20-30 something friends living in
                    Manhattan. Episodes typically depict the friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues.
                    Friends aired on NBC for 10 seasons, from 1994 to 2004 and starred Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox,
                    Lisa
                    Kudrow, Matt LaBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer.
                    The show begins when Rachel Green flees her wedding day and seeks out childhood friend Monica
                    Geller, a
                    New York City chef. They become roommates, and Rachel joins Monica's social circle of single people
                    in
                    their mid-20s: struggling actor Joey Tribbiani, business professional Chandler Bing, masseuse and
                    musician Phoebe Buffay, and newly divorced paleontologist Ross Geller, Monica's older brother. To
                    support herself, Rachel becomes a waitress at Central Perk, a Manhattan coffeehouse where the group
                    often hangs out; when not there, the six are usually at Monica and Rachel's nearby West Village
                    apartment, or Joey and Chandler's across the hall.

                <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Although the producers thought of Friends as "only a TV show", psychologists investigated the
                        cultural impact of Friends during the series's run. Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed "The
                        Rachel"
                        and copied around the world. Joey's catchphrase, "How you doin'?", became a popular part of
                        Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends. The series also
                        influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found
                        that
                        the characters used the emphasized word "so" to modify adjectives more often than any other
                        intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular,
                        usage on
                        the series may have accelerated the change. Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for
                        sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech.
                        Friends has also been credited in helping non-English speaking students to learn the language. A
                        2012 poll by Kaplan International English Colleges found that more than a quarter (26%) of its
                        students cited the sitcom as the best show for helping them improve their English.</p>
